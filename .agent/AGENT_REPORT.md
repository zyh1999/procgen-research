# Executor Report

## Task

Set up the planner-executor infrastructure only. No research task was started.

## Work completed

- Created the repository-specific `GOAL.md`, `STATE.md`, `TASK.md`, and this
  report under `.agent/`.
- Added `.agent/supervisor.sh` with task-readiness, branch, report-status, and
  single-objective execution guards.
- Preserved all pre-existing untracked research files outside `.agent/`.
- Created/used the `agent-work` branch.
- Published the repository's reports, code, and experiment logs, with model
  weights and checkpoint paths excluded by `.gitignore`.

## Validation

- Shell syntax check: PASS (`bash -n .agent/supervisor.sh`).
- Unassigned-task refusal check: PASS (exit 4; Codex was not invoked).

## Git

- Infrastructure commit: `d0bf3a7a43225f227812a28ce9def3b8ff6e3670`
- Research-content commit: `d88c1f8eeb6320672ea604a2163106e1f4294a42`
- Remote target: `git@github.com:zyh1999/procgen-research.git`.
- Push: completed to the public `agent-work` branch.

## Planner action required

Replace `TASK.md` only when a bounded research task is ready.
